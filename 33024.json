Abu Naasir Abid Zargar ¶ The Methodology of Calling to Allaah ¶ From Ibn Abbaas, (radi allaahu anhumaa) that when the Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) sent Mu'aadh to Yemen he said: ¶ \"Verily you are going to a people from the people of the Book. So let the first thing that you call them to, be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah (and in another narration: that they single out Allaah for worship). So if they obey you in that, then inform them that Allaah has obligated upon them five prayers in every day and night. And if they obey you in that, then inform them, that Allaah has obligated upon them the charity taken from their rich and given to their poor. So if they obey you in that, then avoid taking the best of their possessions and fear the supplication of an oppressed person because there is no screen between his supplication and Allaah.\" ¶ Reported by al-Bukhaari1, Muslim2, an-Nasaa'ee3, Ibn Maajah4, ad-Daarimi5 and Ahmad6. ¶ The Reporter of the Hadeeth",

He was one of the most prolific narrators from amongst the Sahabah, one of the Abaadilah (plural of Abdullah) and from the jurists amongst the Companions, he died in 68 A.H., may Allaah be pleased with him. ¶ The Meaning of the Hadeeth ¶ The hadeeth clarifies the necessary steps which the caller to Allaah is obliged to follow. So the first obligatory step that he begins with is the call to Tawheed and singling out Allaah alone for worship and staying far away from minor and major shirk. This is established by the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammed is the Messenger of Allaah. ¶ The intended meaning of this testification is that worship, in all its forms, is the established right of Allaah alone, and no one except Him deserves anything from it, neither an angel brought near, nor a prophet sent, nor a righteous man, nor a stone, nor the sun, nor the moon. ¶ So there is no one to be called upon except Allaah alone, aid is not to be sought from anyone except Him, help is not to be sought from anyone except Him and no one except Him is to be truly relied upon, feared and hoped in.",

And whoever commits Shirk with Allaah then verily Allaah has prohibited Paradise for him and his abode is the Fire and there is no helper for the oppressors (i.e. those who commit Shirk) ¶ It is not sufficient to merely utter lailaaha illalaah. Rather, it is necessary to know its meaning, to act in accordance with its requirements and to fulfil its conditions, which are seven: ¶ 1) Knowledge the nullifier of Ignorance. ¶ 2) Certainty the nullifier of Doubt. ¶ 3) Acceptance the nullifier of Rejection. ¶ 4) Compliance the nullifier of Abandonment. ¶ 5) Sincerity the nullifier of Shirk. ¶ 6) Truthfulness the nullifier of Falsehood. ¶ 7) Love the nullifier of that which contradicts it. ¶ The intended meaning by the testification that ‘Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah’ is to have knowledge of its meaning and to act in accordance with its requirements. So similarly it is not merely uttering it, rather it is to believe and testify to the truth of everything he informed us of; to obey him in whatever he commanded; to avoid whatever he forbade and prohibited; and to worship Allaah only with that which He prescribed upon the tongue of the noble Messenger, without desires and without innovation.",

So they passed by a people from the Mushrikeen devoting themselves around a tree, seeking blessings from it and glorifying it. So when those new Muslims saw them doing this they asked the Messenger of Allaah to appoint a tree for them upon which they could hang their weapons to seek blessings by it and not to worship it. They thought that Islaam permitted this type of seeking blessing and that by this they could ensure victory over their enemies. ¶ The Messenger of Allaah was startled by this amazing request so he said this great statement, which is a lesson for the Ummah to take heed from, up until the Day of Judgement: ¶ “Allaahu Akbar, by Him in whose hand is my soul, verily what you have said is just as the Bani Isra’eel said to Moosaa: ¶ “Appoint for us a god, just like they have gods, he (Musaa) said: Verily you are an ignorant people.”[7:138]",

I declare Allaah free and far removed from all that they associate as partners with Him, and I am free of those who worship anything else along with Him.”1 ¶ Indeed calling to Allaah was the mission of all the Messengers and their followers, in order to bring the people out from darkness and into light, from unbelief (kufr) to true Faith (eemaan), from shirk2 to tawheed3, and from the Fire to Paradise. This call to Allaah rests upon firm pillars, and is established upon foundations which are absolutely essential. If any of these are missing the da’wah will not be correct and will not produce the desired results - no matter how much effort is expended and time wasted - and this is the reality which we witness with regard to many of the present day calls which are not supported by those pillars and built upon those foundations. These pillars which support the correct da’wah are clearly shown in the Book and the Sunnah, and can be summarised as follows: ¶ 1. Knowledge of that which one calls to: ¶ Since the ignorant person is not suitable to be a caller (daa'ee). Allaah, the Most High, said to His Prophet (*): ¶ “Say, O Muhammad (*), this is my way: I call to Allaah (to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner) upon certain knowledge (baseerah). I, and those who follow me.”4",

            "nass": "'  Baseerah' is knowledge. So the caller is certain to face those who are scholars of misguidance, those who will attack him with doubts and futile arguments in order to rebut the truth. Allaah, the Most High, says, ¶ “And argue with them in a way that is better.”5 ¶ Furthermore the Prophet (*) said to Mu’aadh, radiyallaahu ‘anhu, \"You are going to a people from the People of the Book.\" So if the caller is not armed with sufficient knowledge for him to face every doubt and contend with every opponent, then he will be defeated in the first encounter, and will be halted at the beginning of the way. ¶ 2. Acting in accordance with that which he calls to: ¶ So that he will be a good example - his actions attesting to his words, and leaving no excuse for the opponents of the Truth. Allaah, the Most High, said about His Prophet Shu'ayb that he said to his people: ¶ “I do not wish to forbid you from something and then do it myself. Rather I only wish to rectify you as far as I am able.”6 ¶ Allaah, the Most High, said to His Prophet Muhammad (*): ¶ “Say, O Muhammad, indeed my Prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are all purely and solely for Allaah, Lord of all the Worlds. There is no share in any of that for other than Him. That is what my Lord ordered me, and I am the first of this nation to submit to Allaah as a Muslim.”7 ¶ Allaah, the Most High, said: ¶ “Who is better in speech than one who calls the people to Allaah and does righteous deeds?”8 ¶ 3.

Beginning with what is of primary importance, then with that which comes next in importance, and so on: ¶ So firstly he calls to the correction of ‘aqeedah (belief and creed) - by ordering that all worship is made for Allaah, and shirk is forbidden. Then ordering the establishment of the Prayer, and the payment of the Zakah, and that the obligatory duties are carried out and that forbidden things are avoided. This was the procedure followed by all of the Messengers, as Allaah, the Most High, says: ¶ “We sent a Messenger to every nation, ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah.”11 ¶ Allaah, the Most High, says: ¶ “We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (*), except that We revealed to Him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah - so make all of your worship purely for Allaah.”12",

So if they accept that then inform them that Allaah has obligated five Prayers upon them in each day and night ... \" ¶ The best example of giving da’wah is to be found in the method of the Prophet (*) - it is the most perfect and complete methodology - in that he (*) remained in Makkah for thirteen years, calling the people to tawheed and forbidding them from shirk, before (he ordered) them with Prayer, Zakaat, Fasting and Hajj, and before he (*) forbade them from usury, fornication, theft and murder. ¶ 5. Patient perseverance in facing difficulties encountered in calling to Allaah, and in facing harm from the people: ¶ For the path of da’wah is not strewn with roses, rather it is covered with hardships and hazards. The best example of this is the case of the Messengers, may Allaah’s Praises and Blessings of peace be upon them all, with regard to the harm and the mockery which they suffered from their people. As Allaah, the Most High, said to His Messenger (*): ¶ “Indeed Messengers were mocked before you, but those who mocked them were overtaken by the punishment which they made light of.”13 ¶ He, the Most High, said: ¶ “Indeed Messengers were also denied before you, but they bore these denials with patient perseverance, and they suffered harm until Our help came to them.”14",

The caller must be a person of good manners: ¶ He must use wisdom in his call, since this will be an important reason for the acceptance of his call. Just as Allaah ordered His two noble Prophets, Moosa and Haaroon, that this was the manner in which they were to face the worst unbeliever upon the earth - Fir'awn (Pharaoh) - who claimed Lordship for himself. Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, said: ¶ “And speak mildly to him that he might accept admonition or fear and obey Allaah.”15 ¶ Allaah, the Most High, said to Moosa, ‘alayhis-salaatu was-salaam: ¶ “Go to Fir'awn (Pharaoh) who has transgressed all bounds in his haughtiness, pride and disbelief, and say, ‘Will you not purify yourself from the sin of disbelief and be obedient to your Lord, so that you may submit fearfully to Him and obey Him?’”16 ¶ Allaah, the Most High, said, concerning His Prophet Muhammad (*): ¶ “By the Mercy of Allaah you behaved with gentleness to them and had you been severe and harsh-hearted they would have left you and departed.”17 ¶ Allaah, the Most High, says: ¶ “Indeed you, O Muhammad (*), are on an exalted standard of character.”18 ¶ He, the Most High, says:",

The caller must remain firm in his expectation and hope for good: ¶ He should not despair of the effectiveness of his call, or about the guidance of his people. Nor should he despair about the aid and the help of Allaah, even if a long time passes, and again he has the best example in this matter in the Messengers of Allaah. So the Prophet of Allaah, Nooh, ‘alayhis-salaatu was-salaam, remained amongst his people for nine hundred and fifty years, calling them to Allaah. ¶ Also when the harm and the hurt of the unbelievers became severe against the Prophet (*), and the angel of the mountains came to him (*) asking if he wanted him to crush them between the two mountains, he (*) replied, \"No, I wish to have patience with them, hopefully Allaah will produce from their offspring those who will worship Allaah alone, not giving any partner to Him.\" 20 If the caller lacks this attribute he will halt at the start of the path and feel discouraged and frustrated.",

How can we demand that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to two men disputing about a sheep or a camel before demanding that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to those who worship idols and graves, and those who deny or hold heretical beliefs with regard to Allaah’s Names and Attributes, divesting them of their true meanings, or distorting them?! Are these people not greater criminals than those who fornicate, drink wine and steal?! Those are crimes against mankind, whereas shirk and denial of Allaah’s Names and Attributes are crimes against the Creator, the One free of all imperfections, and the right of the Creator has precedence over the rights of the creation. ¶ Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah says in his book, al-Istiqaamah (1/ 466): “So these sins along with correct tawheed are better than corrupted tawheed in the absence of these sins.”21",

All of these are innovated ways, taking as their starting point matters which were left until last in the call of the Messengers. This is just like the case of one who seeks to cure a body whose head has been cut off, since the place of ‘aqeedah in the religion is like the head with regard to the body. So it is necessary for these groups to correct their concepts and understanding by referring back to the Book and the Sunnah in order to know the methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah. For indeed Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, informed that correct rule and sovereignty, which is the central part of the call of the former Jamaa'ah whom we mentioned, cannot be achieved except after correcting ‘aqeedah such that all worship is for Allaah alone, and worship of everything else is abandoned.

And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear, providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord, then they are the rebellious transgressors.”23 ¶ So these people wish to establish the Islamic State before purifying the lands of idolatrous beliefs which take shape in the worship of the dead, and devotion to tombs, such as is no different to the worship of al-Laat, al-’Uzzaa and the third of them Manaat,24 rather it is worse. So they are attempting that which is impossible. ¶ Indeed establishment and application of the Sharee'ah and the prescribed punishments; establishment of the Islamic State; avoidance of whatever is prohibited; and achievement of whatever is obligatory - all of these things are from the rights of tawheed, and matters which perfect it and follow on from it.

It further quotes intellectual and physical proofs for them in all the Soorahs and in most of its stories and examples. This is known to those who have full understanding, are able to consider carefully and comprehend well. All the Books revealed by Allaah have given great importance to these points and all of the revealed ways are agreed upon them. Then the most important and sublime of these three principles, and the most fundamental of them all is tawheed of Allaah, the Blessed and the Most High. This is to be found in most of the Soorahs of the Qur’aan, with its three well known categories, indeed it is found actually in every Soorah of the Qur’aan.

If you do not cease abusing and reviling them I will certainly revile you. Go away from me if you wish to remain safe from me.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘But you are safe from me harming you, I will rather ask my Lord to guide you and forgive your sins. He has always been most Gracious and Kind to me. I shall keep away from you and all that you worship besides Allaah, and I will worship and invoke my Lord, making all of worship purely for Him.

Guiding the misguided to the Straight Path. It was opposed by blind bigotry and partisanship, based upon desires, ignorance, stubborness and obsinate pride: otherwise how could anyone worship and humble themselves to those who cannot hear, nor see, nor help them in any way?! ¶ Indeed the knowledge of tawheed, O reader, is that knowledge which all the Prophets were honoured with, and with it they assaulted falsehood, ignorance and shirk. So ignorance of this knowledge, the knowledge carried by the Prophets, which guides to the truth and saves from misguidance and shirk, ignorance of this is fatal and is a deadly poison which kills the intellect and the ability to think. ¶ “O my Father, Allaah has given me knowledge which has not come to you, accept the sincere advice which I give to you, and I will show you the Straight Way, upon which you will not go astray.”74",

Allaah, the Most High, says: ¶ “Do you not consider the one (Namrood) who, because Allaah had granted him an extended kingdom disputed with Ibraaheem about his Lord.

But he exceeded all bounds in his arrogance and haughtily refused to accept the tawheed of Allaah and to give up on his claims to Lordship. So Ibraaheem debated with him in this brilliant manner whose proof was clear. Ibraaheem said, ¶ “It is my Lord (Allaah) Who gives life and death.”76",

Then He causes them to die with His Power, and that He gives the humans and animals death at the end of their appointed life-spans, due to visible causes which He shows and without visible causes. So when Ibraaheem saw that he tried to create a pretence to evade the issue, which might fool some of the ignorant and common folk, he then said, as a means of showing the futility of what his saying entailed, that if you are as you claim, then, ¶ “‘Allaah causes the sun to rise from the east, so if you are truthful then cause it to rise from the west.’ So the unbeliever was confounded.”77 ¶ So the unbeliever was left confounded and at a loss for words. His argument was overthrown, he was silenced, struck dumb and falsehood was rendered futile as is always the case. So this contains a lesson for those who listen attentively and witness it, that the call to tawheed represents the peak of sincerity, wisdom and intelligence; it proceeds in the due and correct manner, and as Allaah has willed, not merely struggling for kingship, nor seeking to fight for leadership.",

This is from Allaah’s favour upon us and upon the people, yet most of the people do not give thanks for Allaah’s favours. O my two companions in the prison, is it better that you worship many different lords, or that you worship only Allaah, the One, Who subdues and has full power over everything? You do not worship besides Allaah except idols which you call gods, which you and your forefathers give names to, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. Authority is for Allaah alone.

He experienced at first hand their plots, their oppression, their unjust persecution and imprisonment by them. Furthermore he lived amongst an idolatrous nation who worshipped idols, cattle and stars. So where was correction to begin? What was the starting point? ¶ Did he begin calling to Allaah, whilst he was wrongfully imprisoned along with others who were oppressed like him, by inciting them and rousing them against the despotic and tyrant rulers? This would be without a doubt a political response, and was an opportunity open to him. Or did he begin his call from the starting point adopted by his noble forefathers, and at the head of them Ibraaheem, the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah and the Imaam of the call to tawheed; which was the starting point for all the Messengers of Allaah? There is no doubt that the single way of correction and rectification in every time and place is the way of calling to correct ‘aqeedah and tawheed and that all worship should be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone. ¶ Therefore Yoosuf began from this starting point, following his noble fathers, proud of their ‘aqeedah, and deriding and exposing the foolishness of the idolaters and their practice of taking idols, cattle and stars as lords to be worshipped besides Allaah. ¶ So after clearly explaining this, and openly calling to tawheed and to rejection of shirk, he emphasised his call and his argument by his saying,",

That is the Straight and true reigion, yet most of the people do not know (and are people of shirk).”91 ¶ Also Yoosuf, ’alayhis-salaam, attained the highest position in this state92 whilst calling to the tawheed of Allaah and establishing the clear proofs for his call and his Prophethood. Allaah, the Most High, says, in explanation of this, ¶ “The king of Egypt said, ‘Bring him to me, I will make him my personal servant.’ So when he spoke to Yoosuf, he said, ‘Verily, this day you have with us a position of rank and full trust.’ He said, ‘Place me in charge of the storehouses and wealth of the land, indeed I will guard them faithfully and with full knowledge.’”93 ¶ And he said, giving thanks to his Lord and Protector, ¶ “O my Lord, You have bestowed upon me something of dominion and have taught me the interpretation of dreams. O Originator and Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my Lord and Protector in this world and the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim and join me with the righteous.”94 ¶ Furthermore Allaah says in explanation of his da’wah, upon the tongue of the Believer from the family of the Pharaoh:",

Furthermore there is to be no leniency or relaxation in fighting against shirk, it is not permissible to keep silent about it, whatever the circumstances of the caller to Allaah; rather it is not permissible for any Muslim to ever accept it or be relaxed about it. So this shows the high station of ‘aqeedah, and its importance with Allaah, and with His Prophets and His Messenger. It also shows the very great difference and the distance between it and the details of Islaam. ¶ It is not permissible for the Muslim, particularly the caller, to take up any position which violates his ‘aqeedah or is contrary to it, or that he is a fortune-teller, those who are Mushriks, or that he is a custodian of their idols. If he does any of this then he is one of the misguided Mushriks. With regard to the legislative aspect, if the Islamic state is established, it must apply the Sharee'ah of Allaah, otherwise: ¶ “And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the ones guilty of unbelief.”96",

So the Muslim may take up a position in a non-Muslim state with the condition that he establishes justice, and that he does not obey them ina matter which involves disobedience to Allaah, and does not judge by other than what Allaah sent down. This was what the Prophet of Allaah, Yoosuf, did.

These types of callers have caused themselves to fall into a deep abyss, whilst they think that they have reached the highest peaks.

Moosaa was brought up and was raised in the palaces of the greatest tyrant who claimed divinity. He knew the various types of corruption, unbelief, tyranny, injustice and despotism from what he witnessed in the palaces. He saw things which it is difficult to imagine or think possible. He also saw the enslavement of his people, the Children of Israa’eel, and their humiliation, and their women taken as slaves, and the killing of their children, to such an extent that it surpassed any oppression known to mankind. Allaah, the Most High, says, ¶ “Pharaoh exalted himself haughtily in the land, and divided its people into castes. He enslaved a group of them (i.e., the Children of Israa’eel), killing their sons and letting their women live. He was indeed one of the corrupt evil-doers.”98 ¶ The people of Pharaoh were also people of shirk and idol-worship without a doubt. ¶ So how did Moosaa begin? Was his call directed to correction of the ‘aqeedah of this idolatrous nation? Or did it begin with a demand for the restoration of the rights of the Children of Israa’eel, and a struggle to gain rulership and authority from the hands of the tyrant, and at the head of them Pharaoh, who claimed divinity for himself? ¶ The call of Moosaa was just like the call of his forefathers and brothers from the earlier Prophets. His Lord instructed him and inspired him with the principle of tawheed, and chose him to carry his revelation, and to establish worship of Him. Allaah, the Most High, says,",

Remove your shoes, indeed you are in the purified valley of Tuwaa. I have chosen you as My Messenger, so listen to and heed what I reveal to you. Indeed I am Allaah. None has the right to be worshipped but Me. So worship Me and do not worship anything else besides Me, and establish Prayer forr My remembrance. Indeed the Final Hour is certainly coming, which I keep hidden from all except Myself, in order to reward each soul according to its good or bad deeds.’”99 ¶ So this was the beginning of his Messengership; he was inspired and ordered with the ‘aqeedah of tawheed. He was ordered to establish it in himself and to represent it in his life. Then he was entrusted with the duty of calling to this sublime principle and was sent by Allaah to the Pharaoh. Allaah furthermore explained to him the correct manner of giving da’wah and the wise way in which he was to face the Pharaoh. Allaah, the Most High, said: ¶ “Go to Pharaoh who has transgressed all bounds in his haughtiness, pride, unbelief, and say, ‘Will you not purify yourself from the sin of unbelief and be obedient to your Lord? And that I guide you to the worship of your Lord, so that you may submit fearfully to Him and obey Him.’”100",

But he did not respond to this wise and composed call. So Moosaa manifested the great signs and clear proofs of his Prophethood and the truthfulness of his Messengership. But the despotic tyrant Pharaoh merely increased in his transgression and rejection of the truth: ¶ “But Pharaoh denied the signs which Moosaa came with and disobeyed his order for him to fear and obey his Lord. Then he turned away from what he ordered him (i.e., obedience to his Lord) and instead worked evil and corruption, and he gathered his people and his followers and said, ‘I am your lord, the most high.’ So Allaah seized him with punishment for his latter and his earlier saying.”102 ¶ The Escalation of the Tyranny of the Pharaoh and how Moosaa and his People Faced it with Patient Perseverance and Forbearance",

No crime except that they called to the tawheed of Allaah and to remain firm upon it, and to disbelieve in Pharaoh and his idols. Then what was the response of Moosaa with respect to these disgraceful and outrageous transgressions which exceeded all bounds in its barbarity and ferocity?! ¶ His response was to remain firm upon correct belief, and to have patience and forbearance, and to seek the aid of Allaah in facing these calamities. Then he awaited the good outcome, and victory as a consequence and a good fruit of this remaining firm and this patient perseverance. ¶ “Moosaa said to his people, ‘Seeks Allaah’s help and be patient, the earth is Allaah’s, He gives it as a heritage to whom He pleases from His servants. The final outcome is in favour of those who fear Allaah by avoiding disobedience of Him and doing what He orders.’”104",

So release them and cease tormenting them. Indeed we bring you a clear sign from your Lord, and peace and safety from Allaah’s punishment are for those who follow the guidance.’”105 ¶ It was a sublime call to the tawheed of Allaah containing light and wisdom. It was also accompanied by an eager desire for the guidance of those who were being called, and that they should be purified. It also contained a clear example of the utmost patience and forbearance in enduring great harm, and in facing tyranny and haughty oppression. It also shows the way to face the most difficult situations with wisdom and forbearance, whilst having the strongest hope in Allaah, that He will assist and grant victory to the Believers and destroy the unbelieving oppressors.

So as for Allaah’s Messenger (*), Allaah gave him protection through his uncle Aboo Taalib. As for Aboo Bakr, Allaah gave him protection through his people. But as for the rest of them, the Mushriks would take hold of them and dress them in iron armour and place them to scorch and roast in the sun. There was not one of them except that they responded to them except Bilaal, for his soul became as nothing to him for Allaah’s sake, and his people had no respect for him. So they gave him to the children who used to drag him around the streets of Makkah and he would say repeatedly, ‘(He who has the right to worship is) One, One.’”116 ¶ In the Seerah of Ibn Hishaam117 there occurs: ’Umayyah ibn Khalf used to take him (Bilaal) out in the midday heat of the sun, and throw him down upon his back, on the ground of the flat valley bed of Makkah, and he would order for a large rock to be placed on his chest. Then he would say, “By Allaah, you will stay like this until you die, unless you disbelieve in Muhammad (*) and you worship al-Laat and al-’Uzzaa.” So he would say, whilst he was in that condition, “(He who alone has the right to worship is) One, One.”",

The Aayaat of the Qur'aan continued to be sent down with it, and the directions and the orders of the Prophet (*) revolved around it. ¶ (1) Allaah’s Messenger (*) did not suffice even with all this.

They construct them, protect them, worship them and present offerings to them. They firmly believe that they have some supernatural power over and above their own authority. So they hold that these things cause harm and benefit for them due to the unseen power and authority which they think they possess, or at the very least they think they can intercede with Allaah in order for their problems to be reduced.

Then it may be that they respond to his call, or a large number of them do so, and so they gain a state, as a goodly fruit due to their eemaan, their affirmation of what the Prophet came with, and their righteous actions. ¶ They thus establish the obligation upon them of fighting Jihaad to raise up the Word of Allaah, and of following and applying the Sharee'ah and the prescribed punishments and other matters prescrbed for them by Allaah. This is what happened with our Prophet Muhammad (*) and his noble Companions. Allaah crowned their eemaan, their righteous actions, and their exemplary perseverance when facing the harm and oppression of the mushriks, by aiding them and making their Deen uppermost, and by establishing them upon the earth as Allaah, the Most High, says:",

He says: ¶ “Then We revealed to you, O Muhammad (*), that you should follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was a Muslim upon the true religion and was not one of those who worshipped idols and associated partners with Allaah.”212 ¶ So the order to follow him covers adherence to his religion which is tawheed and fighting against shirk. It also covers following his methodolgy in beginning by calling to tawheed. Then Allaah, the Most High, further emphasised this order also by ordering the ummah of Muhammad (*) to follow the way and the religion of this Prophet who was upon the true religion. So He, the Most High, says: ¶ “Say, O Muhammad (*), Allaah has indeed spoken the Truth, so follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was upright, upon the religion of Islaam, and he did not make any share of his worship for any created being.”213",

We also find that Allaah ordered our Prophet to follow them and to follow their methodology.

So if a system of prescribed laws has no ‘aqeedah, then it will be ruined and will not remain as a correct and sound system of prescribed laws. So, for example, the prescribed laws followed by Ibraaheem, ’alayhis-salaatu was-salaam, remained for centuries amongst the Arab nation, then when ’Amr ibn Luhayy al-Khuzaa’ee entered shirk into it, then it became an idolatrous system of laws and its reality changed and it became corrupted and ruined. This was because it was the ‘aqeedah of tawheed which provided its firm foundation upon which it stood. From Aboo Hurayrah, radiyallaahu ‘anhu, who said that Allaah’s Messenger (*) said, “I saw ’Amr ibn ’Aamir al-Khuzaa’ee dragging his intestines in the Fire. He was the first one who introduced the practice of setting animals free for the sake of their deities.”215 So Aktham said, “Perhaps the fact that I resemble him216 will cause harm to me, O Messenger of Allaah?” He (*) said, “No, you are a Believer and he was an unbeliever. He was the first one who altered the religion of Ismaa’eel. He created the idols, and established the practice of keeping the milk of certain animals for the deities, and of freeing animals for the sake of the idols, and of freeing for their idols the she camels which gave birth to female camels as their first and second deliveries, and of freeing for their idols male camels completing their allotted number of sirings.”217",

Allaah’s Messenger (*) taught the Prayer by practical examples, and he said: “Pray as you have seen me praying”220 So he (*) began by standing, then the takbeer, then the recitation, then the rukoo’, then the sujood, and he did this in every rak’ah.

The Hajj. Allaah’s Messenger (*) performed Hajj and taught the people the rites of Hajj, and said, “Take your rites of pilgrimage from me.” He made the standing in Arafah in a specific place, at a specific time, the ninth day, and he made the night-stay in Muzdalifah on a particular night, and he made the Day of Sacrifice, and the days and nights of Tashreeq in a particular time and place. He also made the Tawaaful-Ifaadah at a particular time, and he laid down a particular place for the Sa’ee between Safaa and Marwaa, its starting point and finishing point were laid down. So if a Jamaa’ah wished to change any of these rites and alter their time or place, for example saying, “We want the Tawaaful-Ifaadah to be performed on the ninth day, and to be done between Safaa and Marwaa, and we want to move the standing in ’Arafah to the eighth or the tenth day, and that it should be done in Muzdalifah or Minaa, and we want the sacrifice to be done in ’Arafah, or we want to bring some rites forward and delay others according to what will be helpful and according to the stituation of the pilgrims.” Then would this be an Islamic Hajj, or would it rather be an evil distortion and a disfigurement of this rite?!!",

Likewise if you were to examine many of the practices and customs which have found their way into the Islaam practiced by some tribes, and were then to see the practices and customs of the non Muslim people of the same tribes - you would find that there is very little difference between them.",

He knew its history, and he knew the extent to which the beliefs of the Muslims were connected to and influenced by the beliefs of their forefathers and indeed present day idolaters. Then he criticised the Muslim rulers of the past for falling short in their duty of propagating Islaam, and failing to assist those individuals who strove to propagate Islaam, and for failing in their duty of establishing Islamic education. So this profound understanding should have lead him to see the strength of the methodology of the Prophets in calling to tawheed, and that all worship should be made purely for Allaah, and in concentrating upon giving importance to the Muslims’ ’aqeedah in order to save them from the claws of the shirk of Hinduism, Buddhism and their like. Indeed it was upon him that he should desist from opposing the callers to tawheed at the very least - if he was not going to assist them with the strength he was given in da’wah and writing - and that he should assemble his followers in this field instead of applying huge resources in the field of politics and economics.",

Since the pillars of eemaan are the things which are essential for the attainment of eemaan, such as the two testifications of faith, so a person cannot be a Believer unless he testifies that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad (*) is the Messenger of Allaah.",

So how about when we know necessarily from his religion that the huge throng of people who entered into his religion, did not have the imaamate made a condition for eemaan upon any of them, neither in general nor in particular.”260 ¶ I have given a lengthy quote from Ibn Taymiyyah, rahimahullaah: ¶ 1 - Due to his being one of the foremost scholars of the religion, and his standing and the trust which the people have for the strength and depth of his understanding of Islaam, and their belief in his sincerity. ¶ 2 - Due to the similarity between the claims of Maududi and the claim of the Raafidee Shee’ee. Indeed it is very unfortunate that the reader will see that the claims of Maududi are even greater than the Shee’ee who said, “It is the most important of the rulings of the religion,’261 and he said, “And it is one of the pillars of eemaan.” Whereas Maududi declared it to be, “The most important question in human life and the most important principle,” and, “The most important goal of the Prophets,” as will follow.",

Then they should not equate the speech of any human with them, no matter what position and status they hold. This is what is demanded by eemaan and is a proof of a person’s sincerity. ¶ The View of the Scholars of Islaam with Regard to the Imaamate and their Proofs of its Obligation ¶ Imaam Abul-Hasan al-Maawardee, rahimahullaah, said, “The imaamate is established to achieve khilaafah (caliphate) upon the Prophetic way in safeguarding the religion, and in running the worldly affairs and it is obligatory by consensus (ijmaa’) to place in that position one who will carry out that duty in the ummah. Even if al-Asamm was an exception, and people disagreed as to whether its obligation was due to the intellect or the Sharee'ah. So a group said, ‘It is obligatory based upon the intellect due to the nature of intelligent people which causes them to accept a leader who will prevent them from mutual oppression. Al-Afwah al-Awdee said, ‘The people will not be rectified by a state of anarchy, there being no leader for them, nor will there be leadership if the ignorant take control.’’",

Then they agree upon its obligation due to the saying of Allaah, the Most High: ¶ “O you who believe, obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority over you.”262 ¶ “So it is obligatory upon us to obey those in authority amongst us, and they are the leaders in authority over us.’ Then he said: Hishaam ibn ’Urwah reported from Aboo Saalih from Aboo Hurayrah that Allaah’s Messenger (*) said, “After me rulers will take charge, so you will be ruled by righteous rulers, and by wicked rulers along with their wickedness. So hear and obey them in everything that is in accordance with the truth. So if they do good then that is for them and for you. And if they commit evil, then that is for you and against them.” He said, ‘So when the imaamate is established to be obligatory, then its obligation is binding upon some only (Fard Kifaayah), as with Jihaad and seeking knowledge.’”263",

This is because when the Companions differed in the enclosure (of Banoo Saqeefah), and the Ansaar said, ‘There should be a ruler from us and a ruler from you.’ So Aboo Bakr and ’Umar, radiyallaahu ’anhumaa, rebutted this and said, ‘The Arabs will not submit except to this branch of Quraysh,’ and they quoted some narrations in that regard.

So without the desire for authority, there is no meaning for da’wah to a particular philosophy, and there is no meaning for what is lawful and what is forbidden, nor to the prescribed laws.

Then upon this belief he built the idea that every society having a comprehensive theory for life and an all-embracing methodology for running the affairs of the world, that they must by their very nature take possession of authority and seize possession of the reins of control of the affairs.

Since if only two of the huge number of Prophets managed to attain success and triumph, then will an unbeliever, or those weak in eemaan and the ignorant, will they not judge that the rest of the Prophets failed and were frustrated? Even with regard to the strong Believer, is it not to be feared that his eemaan would be shaken and troubled, if it were really the case that the unbelieving Kisraas, and Caesars, and Pharaohs should succeed in the past and the present and reach their desired goal of establishing great states and advanced civilisations, yet the efforts of the Prophets did not meet with success and victory?! ¶ If we lay down these goals and make false and fanciful judgements about the calls, then the result will appear to be very bad, and the problems which this causes will be very difficult to overcome. However if in deciding what their goals were and describing their actions we depend upon the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (*) who does not speak from his desires, then we will be following the correct methodology. And Allaah has laid down what their goals were, and explained their calls, saying: ¶ “We sent a Messenger to every nation, ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah.”288 ¶ Allaah, the Most High, said:",

So they carried out their duty and all reached the level of success and triumph, and Allaah aided them against their enemies in this world, and will aid them on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth, whereas the unbelievers in these correct standards will be the failures, the losers and the defeated in this world and the Hereafter. Allaah, the Most High, says: ¶ “And the saying has already preceded from Us to Our Messengers that they will be the triumphant ones, and that Our army will be victorious.”290 ¶ Allaah, the Most High, says: ¶ “Allaah has written and decreed: I and My Messengers shall be triumphant over those who rebel against Me. Indeed Allaah has full-power to destroy those who oppose Him and His Messenger, and is All-Mighty.”291 ¶ Allaah explained how His Prophets were victorious over their enemies in many stories in the Qur'aan.

Floating beneath Our Eyes, under Our observation, as a punishment for the peoples unbelief and a reward for Nooh who had been rejected. And We left the Ark as a sign and an admonition for those coming after them. So will anyone accept admonition?”292 ¶ Allaah, the Most High, says: ¶ “Thamood and 'Aad disbelieved in the Last Hour. So as for Thamood, then Allaah destroyed them with the terrible thunderclap, and as for 'Aad, then Allaah destroyed them with a violent and terrific wind which He set upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession.

And the Pharaoh and those before him, and the people of the towns which were overturned and destroyed (i.e., the people of Loot) came committing sins, and they disobeyed the Messenger of their Lord.

And We warned each of them by examples and by making the proof clear to them, and We utterly destroyed them all.”294 ¶ So these were overwhelming and decisive victories granted to the Messengers, and clear triumphs and successes and also defeats, ruins, destruction and annihilation for the unbeleivers. So by these correct and true Qur'aanic standards laid down by Allaah, all of the Prophets attained success and triumph, because they all fulfilled their duty with which they were obligated. They propagated the messages from their Lord which they were duty-bound to propagate, and the end of their enemies was as Allaah has described. Whereas by those political, or imaginary standards, or whatever you wish to call them, none of them succeeded except Muhammad and Moosaa, ’alayhimus-salaam. ¶ This is according to the theory of these people, but as for us, then we declare Moosaa and Muhammad, ’alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam, free from having striven to cause political revolution, and we declare their success and victory above and far removed from having been based upon any such foundation.",

Was it achieved by means of a political revolution through which Moosaa attained a throne of Egypt? The true answer is what Allaah informed us in the sublime Qur'aan. That Allaah chose and favoured Moosaa with Messengership and with His Speech to him directly. He placed upon him the duty of calling the Pharaoh to Allaah, and he carried out the command of his Lord, and he established the clear signs and proofs of the truthfulness of his message. ¶ “So Moosaa showed the Pharaoh the Great Sign (his hand shining and his rod which became a snake).

So when he came to them with the truth, that they should worship Allaah alone and obey Him, and he established the proof upon them, they said, ‘Kill the sons of those who believe along with him and take their women as slaves.’ But the plots of the unbelievers are nothing but futile error.”297",

He gives it as a heritage to whom He pleases from His servants. The final outcome is in favour of those who fear Allaah by avoiding disobedience of Him and doing what He orders.”299 ¶ Then when the affair reached its peak and the Children of Israa’eel complained to Moosaa: ¶ “They said, ‘We have suffered before you came to us with the message and after you came.’ He said, ‘Perhaps Allaah will destroy your enemy and make you the successors upon the earth, so that He may see how you act, obediently or disobediently.’”300 ¶ Look at the manners in which the Prophets cultivated the people, and their patience in facing the calamities and severe trials, then Allaah reprimanded them so that they may take heed. ¶ “And We tried the people of the Pharaoh with years of drought and failure of fruits and crops, as an admonition so that they might turn back from their error.”301",

Allaah, the Most High, says: ¶ “And We inspired to Moosaa, ‘Travel with the Children of Israa’eel by night and leave the land of Egypt, and you will be pursued by Pharaoh and his army.’ So Pharaoh sent out his men to the cities to gather his army and said, ‘They are only a small band and they have indeed angered us, and we are a host well prepared and armed.’ So We expelled Pharaoh and his people from their gardens and springs, and their treasures and their stations of honour. Thus We expelled them and by destroying them made the Children of Israa’eel their inheritors. So Pharaoh and his army pursued them and reached them at sunrise. When the two hosts saw one another, the people of Moosaa said, ‘We have been caught.’ Moosaa said, ‘That will not be so, indeed my Lord is with me, He will guide me to the way to deliverance.’ So We inspired to Moosaa, ‘Strike the sea with your staff.’ So he did so and it parted. Each side was like a huge mountain. Then We brought the army of Pharaoh near to the sea. And We saved Moosaa and all those with him, and We drowned Pharaoh and those with him in the sea.

Then there is a further point: if it were the case that Moosaa strove to bring about a political revolution and earnestly sought to seize the reins of power and to establish the aspired goal of the messages of the Prophets of Allaah, i.e. the divinely inspired state, then he would have quickly turned back and returned to Egypt since the ideal oppurtunity had risen.

At his hand, Allaah destroyed the despotic tyrant Pharaoh and his army, and with him Allaah saved the Children of Israa’eel, and this is sufficient honour and excellence for him, and sufficient for him is the victory he acheived over the Pharaoh and his people. ¶ Then as for Muhammad (*), then he was a man of ‘aqeedah from the first instant and a Messenger of guidance. He patiently bore that which mountains could not bear, whilst conveying this ‘aqeedah, He was offered sovereignty at the beginning and he refused it and the victory and the establishment of the State of Islaam which Allaah gave him came only as a reward for his patient perseverance, his taqwaa and his forbearance.

And those who hoard up gold and silver and do not spend in the way of Allaah, then give them the tidings of a painful punishment on the Day of Ressurrection.”315 ¶ Allaah’s Messenger (*) died whilst cursing the Jews and the Christians for their deviance in belief, so he said, “Allaah’s curse is upon the Jews and the Christians, they took the graves of their Prophets as places of Prayer.'”316 ¶ The Aayaat and ahaadeeth rebuking them for their deviations in beliefs and manners are many, and there is not a single Aayah mentioning a rebuke of the Christian kings and rulers present in the time of the Prophet, despite their evil and corruption. ¶ So why does the Islamic da’wah have this orientation?",

So over there we see the She'ah and the Raafidees and their various sects, and the evil heretics and apostates who are hidden amongst them.

It is not just a case of being far from the Islamic system and the Islamic Sharee'ah.

And whoever prevents the University students from thinking and giving their view about what affects their country internally and externally, then he is preventing them from a natural right of theirs ... ” Then he said, “However, at the same time, I criticise the University students for the fact that they almost entirely restrict their efforts and attention to the political side, and to using means which are not to be approved of.

Indeed very many scholars from his own land, from the Salafees and others have replied to him. Then this excess of his has travelled and has reached many Arab and Islamic lands, and it has fooled an overwhelming majority of authors and youth, which has led to great neglect of the ‘aqeedah of tawheed, and even comtempt of it and of its people. It has also led people to treat shirk and innovation lightly and has caused al-Maududi and his like to ally themsleves with and to befriend the devotees of the graves and even the Raafidees (Shee'ah), and to gather these people under their banner, to treat them as brothers, to love and defend them and their beliefs and creed, and this is something which is a reality and is clear to everyone possessing intellect and religion. So since the matter has reached this frightful state, I replied to al-Maududi with regard to some of his excess in order to make the people in general aware, and also the people of the Arabian Peninsula, to which the followers of al-Maududi and their helpers direct their attention.",

Is it conditional in order to declare him to be an innovator, that the proof be established against him first, or is this not required? ¶ Benefit us, jazaakaAllahu khayra. ¶ Answer: \"In the name of Allaah The Most Merciful, The Bestower of Mercy. All praise is due to Allaah and may the peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allaah, his family, companions and whosoever follows his guidance. To proceed: ¶ That which is well known from Ahlus Sunnah is that whosoever falls into an affair that amounts up to Kufr (disbelief) then he is not to be declared a disbeliever up until the proof has been established against him. (  من وقع في أمر مكفر لا يكفر حتى تقام عليه الحجة) ¶ As for someone who falls into an innovation, then he is from one of the following categories: ¶ 1) The first category: ¶ Ahlul Bidah (The people of innovations); such as the Rawaafidh, the Khawaarij, the Jahmiyyah, the Qadariyyah, the Mu'tazilah, the Soofees, the Grave Worshippers, the Murji'ah and whosoever is attached and affiliated to them such as the groups 'Al Ikhwaan Al Muslimeen' and Jamaa'tu At Tableegh'.",

Going out in the path of Allaah (really means) going out for war. As for that which they call going out nowadays, then this is an innovation which is not mentioned on the authority of any of the Pious Predecessors. ¶ And going out calling to Allaah is not specific to any particular day(s) rather one should call to Allaah according to circumstances and abilities, without specifying a group (with which to go out with) nor 40 days or more or less. ¶ And similarly from that which is obligatory upon the caller is to have knowledge. It is not permissible to call to Allaah whilst one is ignorant (lacking knowledge). Allaah (Subhaanahu wa-Ta'Aala) says: ¶ {Say: This is my way, I invite to Allaah with sure knowledge ... }, [Soorah Yoosuf, Aayah 108]. ¶ i.e. upon (sound) knowledge, because it is imperative the caller knows what he is calling to from that which is: waajib (obligatory), mustahab (recommended), muharram (impermissible) and makrooh (disliked) and also knows what is shirk, sinning, kufr (disbelief), fisq (open sinning) and knows the (different) levels and the manner in which to forbid and discourage.",

And the recommended nature of not doing something does not prove that it is prohibited. ¶ I (Faalih) say: These words of Shaykh al-Islaam here are clear and in no need of explanation. Prayer is mentioned here due to the invoking of mercy in its supplications. What Shaykh al-Islaam has said here is, \"And he inwardly supplicates for him.\" And supplication is to invoke mercy on someone. ¶ He (sallallaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) used to say when supplicating for the deceased, (( O Allaah! Forgive him and have mercy on him ... )) as found in the hadeeth.",

Whoever withheld from paying over one of them, as a penalty to those like him who behave similarly, as the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) did when he refrained from praying over the one who killed himself, the one who stole from the war booty before its distribution, and the one who had unpaid debts. ¶ And as many of the Salaf did, not praying over the people of innovations. Then acting in accordance with this Sunnah is a good practice ¶ And if someone prays over one of them, seeking Allaah's mercy (for them), while there is no clear advantage in refraining from the prayer, then this is good. ¶ And to withhold from praying over him openly, while inwardly supplicating for him, so as to combine the two benefits, is attaining both advantages, and it is more appropriate than doing one or the other.",

No Muslim would ever think of such a thing. Thus, the only way these words can be understood properly is that the phrase is joined in meaning to what precedes it, and that this is just one of the positions that Shaykh al-Islaam actually held (may Allaah have mercy on him). ¶ Whatever he mentioned in other books that opposes this opinion is possibly an indication that he gave up this view, as other scholars and mujtahids of this Ummah have done – they hold a position until another appears to be more correct, then they retract the first one. ¶ Faalih has worked very hard, going against his normal habits and what he is used to (of laziness), or perhaps someone else worked very hard on his behalf, using computer databases to gather the words of Shaykh al-Islaam from \"Majmoo' al-Fataawaa\" and \"Minhaaj as-Sunnah\" to establish that Rabee' has behaved treacherously and misquoted him, and all those other attacks and accusations.

Refer to \"Mawqif Ahlis-Sunnah min Ahlil-Bida'\" of ar-Ruhaylee (1/ 413), as he has mentioned other sources as well. ¶ Bishr ibn al-Haarith said about the Jahmiyyah, \"Do not sit with them, do not speak with them, do not visit them if they become sick, and do not attend (their funeral prayers) if they die.

Among these issues are those that Shaykh al-Islaam held a strange position in, so much so that opponents of his might claim that he has opposed scholarly consensus. However, they are mistaken in their claim of scholarly consensus, while the opinion he held in the issue may indeed be a strange one. ¶ Al-'Allaamah Burhaan ad-Deen Ibraaheem ibn Muhammad ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah [d.767H], may Allaah have mercy on him, the author of \"Ikhtiyaaraat Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah\" said (p.121): ¶ We do not know of any issue that he has contradicted scholarly consensus in. Whoever claims such a thing is either an ignoramus or a liar. On the other hand, positions that are attributed to him, that he is alone in, are of four types: ¶ The first type is a position that is very strange, and thus it is said about him that he has opposed scholarly consensus, since it was such a rare position that is hidden from many of the people, and due also to the claims of scholarly consensus in the issue by some of the scholars. ¶ The second type is a position that contradicts the four math-habs, however it was the choice of some of the Companions, the Salaf, or the Taabi'oon.

De temps en temps, ce domaine exige de ceux qui sont spécialisés de parler de certaines figures populaires et renommées pour clarifier leurs erreurs ou exposer leurs déviations.

Donc les paroles des savants sont suffisantes pour nous en ce qui concerne ces livres et nous demandons à Allah qu'Il accorde un bénéfice à travers ces livres et qu'ils soient fait purement et sincèrement pour Lui. » ¶ SHAYKH 'ALI IBN HASSAN AL-HALABI AL-ATHARI : ¶ Dans la cassette \"Questions d'un étudiant yéménite aux étudiants d'Al-Albani\", on a demandé au shaykh : ¶ « Quel est votre avis sur le livre de shaykh Rabi’ \"La Méthodologie d'Ahl-us-Sunna wal-Jama'a dans la Critique des Hommes, des Livres et des Groupes\" parce qu'il y a des gens parmi nous qui malheureusement s'abstiennent des livres de shaykh Rabi' ? » ¶ Donc le shaykh a répondu en disant : ¶ « La position du Faqih envers le Safih (personne idiote) ¶ Est la même que la position du Safih vers le Faqih. ¶ Donc celui-ci s'abstient de l’autre ¶ Tandis que l'autre s'abstient plus du premier. »",

En effet, le Prophète, qu’Allah le salue et le bénisse, n’a pas prié sur celui qui s’est donné la mort, sur celui qui a subtilisé quelque chose du butin ou encore sur le débiteur qui ne peut honorer sa dette. D’autres gens doivent, cependant, prier sur lui.

Que son œuvre est loin de la notion de sincérité envers l’islam et les musulmans. ¶ Après avoir examiné ce que lui et d’autres ont rapporté, il apparaît que le cheikh al-Islam s’exprimait sur cette question et tantôt il en parlait d’emblée, comme dans les ikhtiyarat et dans le majmu’ al-Fatawa (24/ 288 - 289), ou encore il donnait la réplique aux gens qui suivent leurs passions, comme dans ‘‘al-minhaj’’. ¶ La différence se situe alors au niveau de la construction, des expressions ou de la longueur.",

En effet, des propos du cheikh al-Islam ‘‘et celui qui prie sur l’un d’eux en lui souhaitant la miséricorde d’Allah’’ il a fait chuter le mot ‘‘lahu’’ avant ‘‘rahmat Allah’’. Il se produit alors un changement de sens. Le souhait de la miséricorde concerne dés lors l’orant et non le défunt. Ceci, selon son école de pensée, constitue une trahison et prive le défunt de la miséricorde !! Par contre, selon l’école de pensée des gens de science et d’équité, il s’agit d’une erreur pour laquelle le citateur ne saurait être attaqué dans son intégrité, ni être taxé de trahison. Quel est donc l’avis de Falih et de la Haddadiyya ? La réponse est que, s’il s’agit d’un haddadite il n’y a aucun mal, même s’il trahit délibérément dans plusieurs pages !!! Par contre, s’il s’agit d’un non-haddadite, il est traître et menteur, même si un mot lui échappe par erreur. Qui plus est, on le traite de traître même s’il n’a omis aucun mot, par méprise ou délibérément.",

Qui sont-ils ? Ce sont les grands haddadites, Falih et son parti. Ce sont eux qui ont levé le drapeau de la sounnah face à Rabi’ et aux opposants de l’imam de Falih qui l’accompagnent !!",

Des agressions verbales et écrites visant la personne du prophète Mohammed -prière pour lui et salut- et ayant pour but de donner une fausse et mauvaise image de sa personne ont émané de la part d'organismes et d'individus chrétiens emplis de haine1 ainsi que de la part de journalistes du Jyllands-Posten qui se sont permis de se moquer du meilleur humain qui soit et du plus parfait des prophètes. Quiconque prendrait compte de la biographie du prophète réalisera que la terre n'a pas connu de personne plus vertueuse que Lui. L'humanité n'a pas connu de personne plus juste, plus charitable ou douée de miséricorde plus que sa personne, que Dieu prie pour lui et le salue. De même aucun message parmi tous les messages des prophètes n'a été aussi parfait ni plus adapté, ni plus juste et clément que le sien. 1 Le journal Magazinet norvégien qui a publié récemment (janvier 2006) les caricatures du Jyllands-posten (septembre 2005) est un magazine chrétien.",

Le message du prophète Mohammed insiste sur le fait que les prophètes doivent être protéges et élèvés au dessus des critiques et des attaques. Ce message a mis l'accent sur l'histoire véritable de ces prophètes, plus particulièrement Moise et Jésus. Et quiconque démentirait Mohammed, le dernier des prophètes, ou rejetterait son message et diminuerait de sa valeur aurait en fait démenti tous les prophètes et aurait diminué de leur valeur tous.

D'autres, brûlés à un degré mortel, agonisaient sur le sol en hurlant de douleur. Tout ce qui se dressait debout dans la région de l'explosion fut anéanti: murs, demeures, usines et autres constructions furent transformés en un nuage de poussière et de débris s'élevant en tourbillonnant vers le ciel. Les tramways furent projetés hors de leurs rails comme s'ils avaient subitement perdu leur équilibre et maintien. Les trains furent de même projetés en l'air comme s'ils n'étaient que des jeux miniatures. 7 Chevaux, chiens et bestiaux subirent le sort des humains. Tout ce qui était vivant perdit la vie de façon indescriptible et atroce. Les arbres disparurent dans les flammes. Les rizières perdirent leur couleur verte.
